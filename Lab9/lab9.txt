1. I calculated the disk space of the working directory (without the .git folder) with the commands:
   cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
   git count-objects -v -H | grep 'size-pack'

To find the size of the git repository, I used the command:
   cd .git/
   du -sh

Size of working directory: 333.34 MiB
Size of Git repository: 350 MiB

To find the largest file(s) in the Git repository, I ran the following command:
   du -h | sort

Output:   
100K    ./logs/refs/heads/old-branches
12K     ./logs/refs/heads/scratch/ns
12K     ./refs/remotes/origin/scratch

80K     ./refs
840K    ./logs/refs
848K    ./logs
96K     ./logs/refs/heads/feature

From inspection, I determined that the file ./objects/pack was the largest file in the repository.

2. To count the number of local and remote branches, I ran the following commands:
   git branch | wc -l
   git branch -r | wc -l

Output:
176
177

To verify that these were the correct number of local/remote branches, I ran the command:
   git branch -a | wc -l

Output:
353

This was in line with my results, as the -a argument shows both local and remote branches, which aligns
with my previous findings.

Local branches: 176
Remote branches: 177

3. To find the number of repositories remote to ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L, I used the command:
   git remote -v

Output:
origin  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (fetch)
origin  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git (push)

From inspection, I determined that there was one remote repository, located at
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git

4. I found the ten local branches most recently commited to with the command:
   git branch --sort=-committerdate | head -n 10

Output:
* master
  scratch/joaot/make-completion-at-point-function
  feature/windows-with-utils
  scratch/completion-api
  scratch/a-modest-completion-redesign-proposal
  scratch/fido-mode
  feature/gnus-select2
  feature/extend_face_id
  scratch/jit-lock-antiblink-cleaned-up
  emacs-26

5. To find the number of commits in the master branch, I ran the following command:
   git rev-list --count master

Output:
139583

6. To find the percentage of commits that are in the master branch, out of all commits across all branches,
I first found the number of commits across all branches with the command:
  git rev-list --all --count

Output:
143910

I then calculated the percentage with a calculator, by plugging in 139583 / 143910. The resulting percentage
was 0.9699 or 97%.

7. I found the ten people with the most master-branch commits since 2013 with the command:
   git shortlog -sn --since="2013" | head -n 10

Output:
  3230  Eli Zaretskii
  3174  Paul Eggert
  2602  Glenn Morris
  1806  Lars Ingebrigtsen
  1389  Michael Albinus
  1367  Stefan Monnier
   576  Noam Postavsky
   516  Dmitry Gutov
   438  Alan Mackenzie
   412  Juri Linkov
