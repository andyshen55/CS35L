Q1.
In terms of speed, I don't think applying the patch would have a noticeable
impact on performance. The main change within the patch is the switch statement.
I can't picture a situation in which that change would result in slower
performance. If anything, the patch would slightly increase execution time.

Q2.
The main difference in expected behavior resulting from this patch is that the
order in which the options are selected for the ls command result in different
behavior. The command ls -a -A now behaves as if the -A option overrides the
previous -a option. Switching the order of the options, as such: ls -A -a now
behaves differently, with the . and .. directories being outputted. Before the
patch, the two commands would have had identical outputs. This change would be
the main one that I would watch out for.
