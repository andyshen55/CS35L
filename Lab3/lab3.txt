Lab 3 Report
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.
I downloaded and verified the coreutils tarball with the following commands:
  wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
  wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
  wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

  gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

The last command output the following text to the terminal:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: /u/eng/class/classmfk/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

The warning message is displayed because there is no evidence that the signature
belongs to the owner of the file.

After verifying the signature, I untarred coreutils-8.29.tar.xz:
  tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
    
2.
I made a directory named coreutilsInstall in my home directory:
  mkdir ~/coreutilsInstall

Which I then installed coreutils-8.29 in:
      cd coreutils-8.29
      cat INSTALL
      ./configure --prefix=/w/home.28/class/classmfk/coreutilsInstall/ &&
      make && make install

I initially ran into a problem when I tried using a relative path for the pre-
fix flag. Changing it to an absolute path resolved the issue for me.

3.
I reproduced the bug by using ./ls instead of just ls. The reason I had to
preface the command with the ./ is that without it the path that ls looks in is
by default /bin/ls.
   cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
   ./ls -a -A

4.
I found  the patch file and applied it using the following commands:
  cd ~/Desktop/CS35L/Lab3/coreutils-8.29
  wget "https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?msg=10;filename=0001-ls-A-now
  -overrides-a.patch;bug=30963;att=1" -O fixls.patch
  man patch
  patch -p1 < fixls.patch

The following message was output to my terminal:
  Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
  1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
  patching file src/ls.c
  Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
  patching file tests/local.mk
  patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh 
   
However, upon inspection of the ls.c file, I found it to be changed as per
the patch_file.

5.
I then typed the following commands (in the untarred directory):
  make

I received an error message stating that automake-1.15 was missing from my
system. The following command from Piazza resolved the issue:
  autoreconf -fi

The reason I had to run this command was that running the ./configure
previously had changed my Makefile. Afterwards, I typed make again.

6.
To test the patch, I tried recreating the bug with ls in the src dir:
   cd src
   ./ls -a -A

The . and .. directories were not in the output of ls. I concluded that the
patch was successful. I then ran the same command on the unmodified directory.
    cd ~/coreutilsInstall/bin
    ./ls -a -A

On this one, the . and .. directories still appeared.
