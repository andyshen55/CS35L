Lab 8 Report
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To setup my BeagleBone, I followed the steps outlined in the Piazza post on Setup Instructions. I first
plugged it into my computer via a micro-usb cable. I then waited for the drive to appear on my computer, after
which I opened START.htm. At this point, I realized there was an issue with my BeagleBone detecting completed
steps. None of the steps in START.htm were highlighted green despite having completed them. I ignored this
and tried downloading drivers but found that installing them was a pain on Windows 10. To circumvent having to
turn off Secure Boot to install the drivers, I decided to just update my BeagleBone with Tyler's SD card. After
updating, I found that the steps were properly highlighted in START.htm. I then ssh-ed into my BeagleBone with
the user profile debian/temppwd. The rest of the setup went as expected. I used connmanctl to connect to the
wifi in the lab, then ran the following commands:
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install xauth
     sudo apt-get install xvfb
     sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-110n-en-gb

I then checked to make sure X11 forwarding was enabled, by changing /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config
to enable X11Forwarding. I also checked to make sure that ~/.ssh/config contained ForwardAgent yes and ForwardX11
yes.

I got the IP address of my BeagleBone, 10.97.85.125, by running ifconfig and looking under wlan0. My partner
found hers, 10.97.85.126, in the same fashion.

After setting up my BeagleBone, I started the lab by generating public and private keys.
      ssh-keygen

I saved the keys to the default location: ~/.ssh/is_rsa, and then created a user account for my partner on my
local system, with the commands:
      sudo useradd -d /home/vaish -m vaishnavi2
      sudo passwd vaishnavi2
      (pineapple)

I then created a .ssh directory for my partner.
       cd /home/vaish
       sudo mkdir .ssh
       sudo chown -R vaishnavi2 .ssh
       sudo chmod 700 .ssh

My partner followed the same set of instructions to make a user profile on her BeagleBone. With her IP address,
I ran the following commands to be able to ssh into her server with key-based authentication.
      ssh-keygen (saved to different location: ~/.ssh/authorized_keys)
      ssh-copy-id -i andy@10.97.85.126

I then added the private key to the authentication agent with:
       eval $(ssh-agent -s)
       ssh-add

I then ssh-ed into my partners BeagleBone. Instead of being prompted for the password she had created for me,
I was able to gain access with my password for the key-pair I had just generated.
      ssh andy@10.97.85.126

To test if port forwarding was enabled, I typed exit to drop the current ssh session. I then ran the following
commands after running XMing.
	 ssh -X andy@10.97.85.126
	 xeyes

I confirmed that the GUI was displayed on my host system, thus verifying that X11 forwarding was properly enabled.
